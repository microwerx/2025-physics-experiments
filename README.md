# 2025-physics-experiments

Physics experiments for my 2025 learning goals. I wonder if it's possible to make these look like they're on a fictional 1980s Commodore-style computer?

## Roadmap

- [Vector Calculus](Vector-Calculus.md)
- [Burgers' Equation](Burgers' Equation)

## Experiments

- [Burgers' Equation](Notebook-Burgers.ipynb)
